Links marked with this icon :door: are _internal to Red Hat_. This includes Jenkins servers, job configs in gitlab, and container sources in dist-git. 

Because these services are internal, in the interest of making all things open, we've copied as much as possible into the link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-images[codeready-workspaces-images] repo.

## What's inside?

NOTE: the so-called master branch is deprecated and is no longer kept up to date. Instead, the latest nightly sources are in **crw-2-rhel-8 branch**, synced to upstream projects' main (or master) branches.

For the latest stable release, see the **crw-2.y-rhel-8** branch with the largest y value.

This repository no longer hosts the CodeReady Workspaces Server assembly that mainly inherits Eclipse Che artifacts and repackages some of them. Server has moved to link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-images/blob/crw-2-rhel-8/codeready-workspaces/README.adoc#how-to-build-locally[codeready-workspaces-images/codeready-workspaces].

### How to Build CRW Containers Using casc Jenkins (REQUIRES VPN)

See this document for how to use those build systems, in order to publish a container image to Red Hat Container Catalog:

### Keeping CRW dependencies in sync with upstream and downstream

Folders under link:dependencies[/dependencies] are synced to https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-images. If no matching project exists under the link:dependencies[/dependencies] folder, sync occurs directly from an upstream Che project. 

The sync logic is in one of three places:

* a Jenkins job - eg., link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-images/blob/crw-2-rhel-8/crw-jenkins/jobs/CRW_CI/crw-theia-sources_2.x.jenkinsfile[crw-theia-sources_2.x.jenkinsfile], 
* a get-sources-jenkins.sh script - eg., link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-images/blob/crw-2-rhel-8/codeready-workspaces-plugin-java8/get-sources-jenkins.sh[plugin-java8 get-sources-jenkins.sh], or
* a sync-*.sh script - eg., link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-images/blob/crw-2-rhel-8/codeready-workspaces-devworkspace-controller/build/scripts/sync.sh[devworkspace controller build/scripts/sync.sh]. 

Note over time we're trying to move all sync logic out of Jenkinsfiles and into scripts that can be run locally, so during outages build process can still be orchestrated. Goal is to have Jenkins simply call sync.sh scripts to perform syncs, and get-sources.sh scripts to collect assets from Jenkins (or other places) in order to commit those source tarballs + trigger Brew builds.

Sync jobs:

* https://main-jenkins-csb-crwqe.apps.ocp-c1.prod.psi.redhat.com/job/CRW_CI/ (jobs) :door:
* https://gitlab.cee.redhat.com/codeready-workspaces/crw-jenkins/-/tree/master/jobs/CRW_CI (sources) :door:
* https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-images#jenkins-jobs (copied sources)
