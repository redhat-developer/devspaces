# This folder contains forks of the upstream Che plugin and devfile registries.

* che-devfile-registry
* che-plugin-registry

## Builds will:

* fetch 3rd party sources, dependencies, and any applicable patches (eg., from npm/yarn/golang projects & registries)

* collect link:https://github.com/devspaces-samples/[sample projects] and link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/devspaces-vscode-extensions[vscode-extensions]

* tar sources & binaries used in Brew build

* provide Dockerfile (synced w/ transformations to pkgs.devel for use in Brew), which can be also used to build the container locally

## In the link:https://github.com/redhat-developer/devspaces-images[midstream], Brew builds must:

* apply changes to upstream Dockerfile to see Pulp repos and support Brew build process

* fetch 3rd party source/binary tarball, including patches

* push that tar to dist-git lookaside cache so it's available when running the Dockerfile build

* unpack the tar as part of the container build where required

* run a container build

## Downstream, Jenkins and Errata are used to:

* publish CI builds to Quay
* publish releases to Red Hat Ecosystem Catalog
