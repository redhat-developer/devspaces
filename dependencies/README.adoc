# This folder contains the build process metadata for syncing from upstream and building:

* che-devfile-registry
* che-jwtproxy
* che-machine-exec
* che-pluginbroker(s)
* che-plugin-registry

# VS Code extension (.vsix) builds

Third party VS Code extensions must be built from sources and co-published with those sources. See https://github.com/redhat-developer/codeready-workspaces-vscode-extensions

# Builds will:

* fetch 3rd party sources, dependencies, and any applicable patches (eg., from npm/yarn/golang projects & registries)

* tar sources & binaries used in Brew build

* provide Dockerfile (synced w/ transformations to pkgs.devel for use in Brew), which can be also used to build the container locally

# Downstream, Brew builds must:

* apply changes to upstream Dockerfile to see Pulp repos and support Brew build process

* fetch 3rd party source/binary tarball, including patches

* push that tar to dist-git lookaside cache so it's available when running the Dockerfile build

* unpack the tar as part of the container build where required

* run a container build

# Further downstream, Jenkins and Errata are used to:

* publish nightlies to Quay
* publish releases to Red Hat Container Catalog
