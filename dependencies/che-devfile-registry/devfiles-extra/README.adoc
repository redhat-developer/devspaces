Devfiles in this folder are not included in the main registry because they do not work fully in airgapped / restricted environments.

For example, deployments may require s2i or UBI8 images which are not included in the Dev Spaces deployment by default.

If you build a custom devfile registry, you can include them yourself, but will also need to ensure that referenced images are available inside your airgapped / restricted environment.

Here is a partial list of the container images needed to deploy these samples, and where they're referenced.
