1a. Check out 3rd party language server dependencies builder repo (will collect variables later)

1b. Define list of upstream containers & RPMs pulled into them from https://pkgs.devel.redhat.com/cgit/?q=devspaces 

== devspaces-devfileregistry (devspaces-3.15-rhel-8) ==

== devspaces-idea (devspaces-3.15-rhel-8) ==

== devspaces-machineexec (devspaces-3.15-rhel-8) ==

== devspaces-operator-bundle (devspaces-3.15-rhel-8) ==

== devspaces-pluginregistry (devspaces-3.15-rhel-8) ==

== devspaces-server (devspaces-3.15-rhel-8) ==

Short container list (base images only):        /home/sdawley/Git/DevSpaces/devspaces/product/manifest/3.15.0/manifest-containers-base-images-only.txt
Long container list (with dockerfile snippets): /home/sdawley/Git/DevSpaces/devspaces/product/manifest/3.15.0/manifest-containers-binaries-extras.txt

1c. Other than the above, all artifacts used in Red Hat OpenShift Dev Spaces (formerly 
    Red Hat CodeReady Workspaces) Workspaces are now built in RH Central CI Jenkins:
https://main-jenkins-csb-crwqe.apps.ocp-c1.prod.psi.redhat.com/

6. Collect RPM deps

7. Collect MVN deps


8. Collect NPM deps

Short manifest is in file: /home/sdawley/Git/DevSpaces/devspaces/product/manifest/3.15.0/manifest.txt
Long log is in file: /home/sdawley/Git/DevSpaces/devspaces/product/manifest/3.15.0/manifest_log.txt

Overall manifest is in file: /home/sdawley/Git/DevSpaces/devspaces/product/manifest/3.15.0/manifest-all.txt
