== How to run End-To-End tests

==== 1. Run all tests against locally deployed CodeReady Workspaces on OpenShift Origin in grid mode

Simply launch `./e2e-tests.sh`

==== 2. Run tests with specified host and port of CodeReady Workspaces on OpenShift

Launch `./e2e-tests.sh --host=&lt;CodeReady Workspaces host on OpenShift&gt; --port=<port>`

The tests are running with default CodeReady Workspaces credentials:
Default values:

- OPENSHIFT_USERNAME: "developer"

- OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD: "any"

- OPENSHIFT_CHE_NAMESPACE: "codeready"

You can change it by using following system variables
```
export OPENSHIFT_USERNAME=<openshift_web_console_username>;
export OPENSHIFT_PASSWORD=<openshift_web_console_password>;
export OPENSHIFT_TOKEN=<openshift_web_console_bearer_auth_token>;
export OPENSHIFT_CHE_NAMESPACE=<namespace_of_codeready_workspaces_deployed_on_openshift>;
```
where `OPENSHIFT_TOKEN` is optional and is aimed to replace username/password when OpenShift is configured with oAuth. 

==== 3. Setup test admin and test user credentials
Also you can set your own credentials of test user or admin instead of default ones
```
export CHE_ADMIN_NAME=<che_admin_name>
export CHE_ADMIN_EMAIL=<che_admin_email>
export CHE_ADMIN_PASSWORD=<che_admin_password>

export CHE_TESTUSER_NAME=<che_test_user_name>
export CHE_TESTUSER_EMAIL=<che_test_user_email>
export CHE_TESTUSER_PASSWORD=<che_test_user_password>
```

Default values:

- CHE_ADMIN_NAME: "admin"

- CHE_ADMIN_EMAIL: "admin@admin.com"

- CHE_ADMIN_PASSWORD: "admin"

If test user credentials aren't set, tests create random test user.

[source]
----
Usage: ./e2e-tests.sh [-Mmode] [options] [tests scope]

Options:
    --http                              Use 'http' protocol to connect to product
    --https                             Use 'https' protocol to connect to product
    --host=<PRODUCT_HOST>               Set host where product is deployed
    --port=<PRODUCT_PORT>               Set port of the product, default is 8080

Modes (defines environment to run tests):
    -Mlocal                             All tests will be run in a Web browser on the developer machine.
                                        Recommended if test visualization is needed and for debugging purpose.

       Options that go with 'local' mode:
       --web-driver-version=<VERSION>    To use the specific version of the WebDriver, be default the latest will be used: "${WEBDRIVER_VERSION}"
       --web-driver-port=<PORT>          To run WebDriver on the specific port, by default: "${WEBDRIVER_PORT}"
       --threads=<THREADS>               Number of tests that will be run simultaneously. It also means the very same number of
                                        Web browsers will be opened on the developer machine.
                                        Default value is in range [2,5] and depends on available RAM.

    -Mgrid (default)                    All tests will be run in parallel among several docker containers.
                                        One container per thread. Recommended to run test suite.

        Options that go with 'grid' mode:
        --threads=<THREADS>             Number of tests that will be run simultaneously.
                                        Default value is in range [2,5] and depends on available RAM.

Define tests scope:
    --test=<TEST_CLASS>                 Single test/package to run.
                                        For example: '--test=DialogAboutTest', '--test=org.eclipse.che.selenium.git.**'.
    --suite=<SUITE>                     Test suite to run, found:
"$(for x in $(ls -1 src/test/resources/suites); do echo "                                            * "$x; done)"
    --exclude=<TEST_GROUPS_TO_EXCLUDE>  Comma-separated list of test groups to exclude from execution.
                                        For example, use '--exclude=github' to exclude GitHub-related tests.

Handle failing tests:
    --failed-tests                      Rerun failed tests that left after the previous try
    --regression-tests                  Rerun regression tests that left after the previous try
    --rerun [ATTEMPTS]                  Automatically rerun failing tests.
                                        Default attempts number is 1.

Other options:
    --debug                             Run tests in debug mode
    --skip-sources-validation           Fast build. Skips source validation and enforce plugins
    --workspace-pool-size=[<SIZE>|auto] Size of test workspace pool.
                                        Default value is 0, that means that test workspaces are created on demand.

HOW TO of usage:
    Run tests from CodereadySuite.xml against locally deployed CodeReady Workspaces on OpenShift Origin in grid mode using HTTP protocol:
        ./e2e-tests.sh

    Test Eclipse Che assembly and automatically rerun failing tests:
        ./e2e-tests.sh --rerun [ATTEMPTS]

    Run single test or package of tests:
        ./e2e-tests.sh <...> --test=<TEST>

    Run suite:
        ./e2e-tests.sh <...> --suite=<PATH_TO_SUITE>

    Rerun failed tests:
        ./e2e-tests.sh <...> --failed-tests
        ./e2e-tests.sh <...> --failed-tests --rerun [ATTEMPTS]

    Debug test:
        ./e2e-tests.sh -Mlocal --test=<TEST> --debug

== Setup GitHub related tests execution

==== 1. Register GitHub oAuth application

Go to https://github.com/settings/applications/new[OAuth application page] and register a new application:

* `Application name` : `CodeReady`

* `Homepage URL` : `http://&lt;OPENSHIFT_SSO_SERVER_ADDRESS&gt;`

* `Authorization callback URL` : `http://&lt;OPENSHIFT_SSO_SERVER_ADDRESS&gt;/api/oauth/callback`
For OpenShift Origin it has the next format: `http://rh-sso-codeready.<IP>.nip.io/auth/realms/che/broker/github/endpoint`.


Then you should create GitHub identity provider in OpenShift SSO server like it described here https://www.eclipse.org/che/docs/user-management.html#social-login-and-brokering.

==== 2. Configure End-To-End tests to run GitHub-related tests

GitHub related end-to-end tests run by default. You can exclude them from execution by using special parameter `-exclude=github`.

In case of running GitHub-related tests you need to define GitHub test users credentials. Set `CHE_LOCAL_CONF_DIR` environment variable
and point to the folder where end-to-end tests configuration will be stored. Then create file with `.properties` extension in that folder
with the following content:
```
# GitHub test users credentials
github.username=<MAIN_GITHUB_USERNAME>
github.password=<MAIN_GITHUB_PASSWORD>
github.auxiliary.username=<AUXILIARY_GITHUB_USERNAME>
github.auxiliary.password=<AUXILIARY_GITHUB_PASSWORD>
```

== Test development tips

It's impossible to use `@Test(dependsOnMethods)` to express dependency between the tests because it breaks parallel execution of test classes (an issue https://github.com/cbeust/testng/issues/1773)[https://github.com/cbeust/testng/issues/1773)].

`@Test(priority)` can be used instead, and dependent test will be skipped if preceding test with higher priority from the same test class has failed.
Set attribute `@Test(alwaysRun = true)` if test shouldn't be skipped in that case.
